# **🛣️ Milestone 3: Sign Language → Speech Model – Detailed Roadmap**

**📌 Project:** *Think Inclusion Meeting App*  
 **🎯 Goal:** *Develop and demonstrate a real-time AI model that converts sign language into natural-sounding speech, enabling speech-impaired users to actively participate in digital meetings.*

---

## **📄 Introduction & Objectives**

### **🎯 1.1 Purpose**

This milestone focuses on building an AI-powered model capable of:

* ✋ Recognizing sign language gestures (hands, body, facial features)

* 🧠 Converting signs → structured text output

* 🎤 Generating **natural-sounding speech** from text

* ⚡ Operating in **real-time (\<1s latency)**

* 🧩 Supporting initial rollout in **ASL** (expandable to other regional sign languages)

### **✅ 1.2 Success Metrics**

Deliverable: 📄 **Trained AI model \+ Demo** with:

* 🔗 GitHub repository (code \+ trained weights)

* 🎥 Demo video showing real-time conversion

* 📄 Documentation for usage & setup

* 📊 Validation report (accuracy & latency benchmarks)

## **📝 Step 1 – Define Scope & Data Collection (Week 1–2)**

### **🔍 Scope Definition**

* 🌎 Select initial supported sign language (e.g., **ASL** first release)

* 📊 Ensure flexibility for future support (e.g., BSL, regional SLs)

### **📚 Dataset Selection**

#### **📹 Video Datasets**

* **ASLLVD (American Sign Language Lexicon Video Dataset)**  
   🔹 Contains \>3,300 ASL signs in citation form  
   🔹 Produced by 1–6 native ASL signers (\~9,800 tokens)  
   🔗 [Dataset Link](http://dai.cs.rutgers.edu/dai/s/signbank)

* **RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T (German Sign Language Corpus)**  
   🔹 Large-scale continuous German Sign Language dataset  
   🔹 Developed by RWTH Aachen University (Human Language Technology & Pattern Recognition Group)  
   🔗 [Dataset Link](https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/ftp/pub/rwth-phoenix/2016/phoenix-2014-T.v3.tar.gz)  
* **How2Sign**  
   🔹 Multimodal & multiview ASL dataset with \>80 hours of continuous videos  
   🔹 Includes speech, English transcripts, depth data, and video streams  
   🔗 [Dataset Link](https://how2sign.github.io/#download)

#### **✋ Landmark Datasets**

* **MediaPipe** (Google) → Hand, body, facial landmarks

* **OpenPose** → Multi-person keypoint detection (hands, face, body)

### **🌍 Diversity Considerations**

* Include **different skin tones, lighting conditions, signing styles**

### **⏳ Timeline & Output**

* **Duration:** 1–2 weeks

* **Output:** Selected datasets \+ preprocessing pipeline

---

## **⚙️ Step 2 – Preprocessing & Feature Extraction (Week 3\)**

* 🖼️ Extract hand, body, facial landmarks using *MediaPipe / OpenPose*

* 🧾 Normalize gestures → adjust **scale, rotation, speed**

* 🏷️ Label gesture sequences → **sign → words/phrases mapping**

⏳ **Timeline:** 1 week  
 📌 **Output:** Clean dataset with extracted features

---

## **🧠 Step 3 – Model Development (Week 4–6)**

### **🏛️ Model Architecture Options**

* 🧩 **CNN \+ LSTM** → temporal sequence learning

* 🧩 **Transformer-based models** → contextual gesture recognition

### **🔄 Processing Pipeline**

 1️⃣ Gesture Recognition → Structured Text  
 2️⃣ Text → TTS (Tacotron 2 / VITS / FastSpeech 2\)  
 3️⃣ Voice Personalization → Select AI voice (tone, gender, accent)

⏳ **Timeline:** 2–3 weeks  
 📌 **Output:** First working prototype

---

## **🔬 Step 4 – Testing & Validation (Week 7\)**

* 📊 **Accuracy:** Word Error Rate (WER), BLEU score

* ⚡ **Performance:** Latency \< 1 second

* 🧏‍♀️ **User Feedback:** Beta testing with 5,000+ tech talent pool

⏳ **Timeline:** 1 week  
 📌 **Output:** Validation report \+ model improvements

---

## **🎥 Step 5 – Demo Preparation (Week 8\)**

* 🌐 Deploy in a simple demo (Python web app / Jupyter Notebook)

* 🎥 Record demo: *User signs → AI generates speech in real-time*

* 📂 Upload to GitHub with documentation

⏳ **Timeline:** 3–4 days  
 📌 **Output:** GitHub repo \+ demo video
